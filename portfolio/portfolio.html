        <p>
          Hello World! My name is Nolan Martinous. I am a Computer Science
          student from Rehoboth, Massaschussetts who is currently taking classes
          at the University of Massaschussetts Dartmouth. I am driven to learn
          as musch as I can about the computing and programming fields; this
          site is the culmination of my efforts thus far!
        </p>
        <div></div>
        <p>
          Although I am a code junkie now, my educational pursuit started
          elsewhere: Computer Engineering. I was a student at the University of
          Massaschussetts in Amherst for my first year and a half of college. It
          was during an introductory OOP class in Python that I discovered a
          love for programming, but it wasn't until Covid complications and a
          series of school transfers that I finally was able to persue my true
          passion.
        </p>
        <div></div>
        <p>
          Now that I am here and hungry for knowledge, collecting new skills as
          a form of entertainment, I am eager to take on any challenges that
          come my way. This includes any iternships or entry level jobs that
          will help me to gain experience *wink wink*.
        </p>
        <div></div>
        <p>
          I think that you will find my skillset to be diverse and suitable for
          a multitude of positions. I have been aquiring new abilities and
          languages through self-taught methods since I started my journey in
          2019 and I hope that some of my featured projects will highlight this.
        </p>
